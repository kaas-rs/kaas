# Verify that an idempotent producer survives a broker restart
# mid-flight. This is the end-to-end check on gh #12 stage B2:
# without snapshot-on-disk persistence of the producerStates map,
# the post-restart broker would see an in-flight retry as
# "fresh PID, non-zero firstSeq" and reject it with
# OUT_OF_ORDER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER (45), killing the producer.
#
# Strategy:
#   1. Start a 50k-record idempotent run in the background using
#      kafka-producer-perf-test.
#   2. After ~1s (enough for some batches to land), restart the
#      StatefulSet pod that owns partition 0 with kubectl. Pick the
#      broker by reading the live assignment via /healthz on a peer.
#   3. Wait for the producer to finish — its exit code is the
#      pass/fail signal: 0 means it tolerated the restart cleanly,
#      non-zero means a fatal error (likely the stage-B-without-B2
#      OutOfOrderSequenceException).
#   4. Cross-check by reading the partition's high watermark — should
#      be exactly 50000 (no losses, no duplicates).
#
# Required env: kubectl with access to the kaas namespace. Skips
# cleanly when kubectl is missing or returns no pods.
