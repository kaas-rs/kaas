//! Partition + consumer-group placement.
//!
//! Pure functions
//! over `(prev assignment, alive brokers, inputs)`; no state, no
//! I/O. Both shapes — partition placement and group placement —
//! follow the same recipe:
//!
//! 1. **Preserve** any prior assignment whose broker is still in
//!    the alive set. Stable assignments minimise log migration on
//!    the shared PVC.
//! 2. **Place** the rest, levelling each topic over the alive set.
//!    Highest-random-weight hashing keyed on `(topic, partition,
//!    broker_id)` (or `(group_id, broker_id)` for groups) breaks
//!    ties, so placement is deterministic and needs no coordination.
//! 3. **Smooth** the partition layer with two deterministic passes:
//!    cluster-wide to `max(per-broker count) - min ≤ 1`, then
//!    per-topic without disturbing that. Group placement skips
//!    smoothing because each group is a single unit.
//!
//! **Order matters.** Preserve runs *first*, before anything else
//! looks at the layout, which is what keeps the recipe incremental:
//! a recompute only decides the partitions that actually need a
//! decision. Deriving the layout up front and reconciling with `prev`
//! afterwards computes the same thing in steady state but re-derives
//! it from `(topics, alive)` alone — so creating or deleting one
//! topic could migrate partitions of every *other* topic, and each
//! such move costs a real open/recover/close cycle on NFS plus a
//! window where the outgoing leader is still acking writes (gh #206,
//! and the dual-writer window in gh #227).
//!
//! Hash: XXH64 via `twox-hash`, byte-for-byte stable so an
//! assignment written by any release matches a v0.1-written
//! one for the same input (upgrade requirement). The previous
//! FNV-1a 64 had pathological avalanche on broker IDs differing by
//! one byte and drove a 50/25/25 skew on 3-broker clusters
//! (kaas#112).
