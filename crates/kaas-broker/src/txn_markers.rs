//! COMMIT / ABORT marker dispatch, shared by the `EndTxn` handler and
//! the marker reconcile (gh #225).
//!
//! A transaction that has been *prepared* owes every partition it
//! touched a control batch. There are two ways that debt gets paid:
//!
//! - **Retry** — the producer re-sends `EndTxn`, the handler re-drives
//!   the same dispatch set, and completes on success.
//! - **Reconcile** — [`reconcile_pending_markers`] sweeps transactions
//!   stuck in `Prepare*` and drives them to completion.
//!
//! Both are needed, and neither subsumes the other. Retry alone leaves
//! a transaction prepared forever when the producer crashes, gives up,
//! or is fenced — and a transaction the *reaper* prepared (a timeout)
//! has no producer to retry at all. Reconcile alone would make every
//! commit wait a full sweep interval. So the handler dispatches inline
//! for latency and the sweep is the backstop that guarantees
//! completion, which is the "idempotent and driven to completion by
//! retry/reconcile" half of NFS substrate rule 2.
//!
//! Until the debt is paid a `read_committed` consumer cannot advance
//! past the transaction's first offset on any of those partitions, so
//! "eventually" is load-bearing: an unpaid marker pins the LSO for
//! every record written after it, not just the transaction's own.
