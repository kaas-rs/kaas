//! The `StorageEngine` trait — the contract every storage backend
//! implements.
//!
//! Phase 2 ships two impls:
//!
//! - [`crate::memory::MemoryStorage`] — `Vec<Bytes>` per partition, used
//!   by dev mode (no `MY_POD_NAME`) and unit tests.
//! - `DiskStorageEngine` (follow-up commit) — segment files, manifest,
//!   producer snapshot, group-commit committer task, takeover.
//!
//! The trait is `dyn`-compatible (no generics, no `Self: Sized` methods,
//! async fn via `async_trait`). Every consumer holds
//! `Arc<dyn StorageEngine>`. This is the seam tests mock and the seam
//! the byte-opacity cross-engine test exercises.
//!
//! # Byte-opacity
//!
//! `append` takes raw RecordBatch bytes as `Bytes`. The engine rewrites
//! the first 8 bytes (baseOffset) to the broker's chosen offset before
//! storing — that's "brokers own offsets", and the v2 RecordBatch CRC
//! deliberately starts at byte 21 so this overwrite doesn't invalidate
//! it. Records bytes (everything past the 61-byte header) are never
//! inspected or modified.
