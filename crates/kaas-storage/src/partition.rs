//! Per-partition write path plus its committer task. One [`Partition`] per
//! `(topic, partition)` tuple; the engine layer ([`crate::engine`]) holds
//! a `DashMap<(String, i32), Arc<Partition>>` and routes calls.
//!
//! # Concurrency model
//!
//! - `Mutex<PartitionInner>` for the **write path**. Append, segment roll,
//!   manifest persist, producer-state mutation — all under this mutex.
//! - `ArcSwap<ReadSnapshot>` for the **read-path observation channel** —
//!   `high_watermark()` / `log_start_offset()` / `epoch()` read without
//!   ever blocking on the mutex. Preserves the gh #134 fix that kept the
//!   OTel gauge alive when a stuck NAS fsync held the partition lock for
//!   the watchdog deadline.
//! - One [`tokio::task`] per partition (the **committer**) that drains
//!   flush requests via an `mpsc::Receiver`. Each cycle runs
//!   `active.sync_log()` under `tokio::time::timeout(FsyncMaxLatency)`,
//!   updates `completed_flush_seq`, and wakes `acks=all` appenders via
//!   [`tokio::sync::Notify`].
//!
//! # Phase 2 initial slice — what's NOT here yet
//!
//! Group-commit (gh #82) — the optimization where the committer fsyncs
//! outside the partition mutex via a cloned log FD — is **not** in this
//! commit. The committer takes the inner mutex for the entire fsync
//! window, which serializes concurrent appenders for the fsync duration.
//! On tmpfs / local SSD that's fine; on NFS it loses the multi-appender
//! throughput multiplier. A follow-up commit on the same gh #156 issue
//! adds the FD-clone trick once the basic Partition is verified
