//! Per-group committed offsets, persisted under
//! `<cluster_dir>/__consumer_offsets/<group>.json` with `tmp + rename`
//! atomicity.
//!
//! The root is the cluster-state directory (`/data/__cluster` by
//! default), NOT the data dir: a sibling of the topic dirs is exactly
//! what the operator's orphan-topic sweep reclaims, and offsets lived
//! there once — every sweep pass deleted them (gh #223). The boot-time
//! adoption shim for the pre-fix layout was dropped under the pre-v1
//! no-backcompat policy: upgrading across gh #223 is a fresh deploy.
//!
//! One on-disk schema: the gh #21 v2 envelope
//! `{"offsets":{...}, "metadata":{...}}`. The legacy v1 plain
//! `map[string]int64` fallback was dropped under the pre-v1
//! no-backcompat policy, so **every writer must go through
//! `write_group`** — serde ignores unknown fields, which means a
//! stray v1-shaped write decodes back as an empty group instead of
//! failing, silently losing every offset in it (that was
//! `delete_partitions` until gh #240).
//!
//! Three layers of state:
//!
//! 1. The visible cache + metadata maps backed by `<group>.json`.
//!    `Commit` / `commit_with_metadata` writes here; `fetch` /
//!    `fetch_metadata` reads here.
//! 2. The transactional **pending** layer keyed on `(group_id, pid)`
//!    — `store_pending` stages, `commit_pending` materialises into
//!    layer 1, `discard_pending` drops. Memory-only: an unfinished
//!    transaction reset on broker restart (matches Apache's "in-
//!    flight offsets aren't recovered" contract).
//! 3. The on-disk file. Lock is dropped before disk I/O — the
//!    "snap then write" pattern, so a concurrent `fetch` doesn't
//!    block on filesystem latency.
