# Storage engine hot path

Group-commit fsync, segment files, the manifest — and how a Produce and a Fetch request travel the broker end to end.

If you know Apache Kafka, you know its produce path leans on two
comfortable assumptions: writes land in the OS page cache, and
durability comes from **replication** — `acks=all` means "on enough
in-sync replicas", not "on disk", which is why almost nobody sets
`log.flush.interval.messages` in production. kaas has neither
assumption available. There are no followers: the only copy of a
partition lives on a shared `ReadWriteMany` volume (the ground rules
for that bet are [the RWX substrate contract](./nfs-substrate.md)), so
`acks=all` has to mean *fsynced to that volume* — and on an NFS-class
mount, every fsync is a COMMIT round-trip over the network. That
round-trip is the dominant cost in the whole broker, and the hot path
is shaped around issuing as few of them as possible: one fsync per
**group** of concurrent batches, an index that is never fsynced on the
hot path, and a manifest that is almost never rewritten.

## A Produce request, end to end

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant L as Listener
    participant H as Produce handler
    participant P as Partition
    participant K as Committer task

    C->>L: Produce (RecordBatch bytes)
    L->>L: read_frame → decode_request_header
    L->>H: dispatch by api_key<br/>(per-listener pre-auth gate)
    H->>H: topic exists? · do I lead it?<br/>heartbeat fresh (self-fence)? · ACL Write?
    Note over H: any gate fails →<br/>NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION (6) /<br/>TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (29)
    H->>P: engine.append(topic, partition, epoch, acks, bytes)
    activate P
    Note over P: under the partition mutex
    P->>P: sticky flush_err? · epoch fence
    P->>P: idempotence classify (PID, epoch, seq)<br/>duplicate → echo cached base_offset, no write
    P->>P: segment full? → roll_fast
    P->>P: rewrite baseOffset → HWM,<br/>append_batch (pwrite, bytes verbatim)
    P->>P: snapshot.store (ArcSwap) — lock-free readers
    P->>P: pending ≥ flush_interval_messages?<br/>→ requested_flush_seq += 1
    deactivate P
    P-->>K: flush request — capacity-1 channel, coalesces
    opt acks = -1 and this append crossed the flush threshold
        Note over P: all concurrent appenders to this<br/>partition park on the same Notify —<br/>one fsync cycle serves them all
        K->>K: lock: target = requested_flush_seq
        K->>K: spawn_blocking → lock + log.sync_all()<br/>30 s watchdog → sticky Stalled on timeout
        K-->>P: completed_flush_seq = target,<br/>notify_waiters()
    end
    H-->>C: ProduceResponse(base_offset,<br/>throttle_time from one post-append quota check)
```

The RecordBatch bytes are never parsed on this path — only two
fixed-size header peeks (producer info for idempotence, offsets for
assignment); the same opaque bytes the client sent land verbatim on
disk. The quota check runs once per request over the summed byte count,
after the appends, and feeds `throttle_time_ms`.

## A Fetch request, end to end

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as Fetch handler
    participant E as Storage engine

    C->>H: Fetch (decode + dispatch, same front door as Produce)
    H->>H: topic exists? · do I lead it? · ACL Read?
    Note over H: read cap = last stable offset (read_committed)<br/>or high watermark (read_uncommitted)
    H->>E: read(topic, partition, fetch_offset, max_bytes)
    E->>E: walk closed segments + active,<br/>copy batch bytes into memory
    E-->>H: Bytes (opaque, undecoded)
    H->>H: trim_to_offset(read_cap) — whole batches only
    H->>H: aborted_transactions_in_range<br/>→ AbortedTransaction list (read_committed)
    H-->>C: FetchResponse(session_id = 0,<br/>records bytes verbatim)
```

Two response-shape facts:

- **Stateless fetch sessions**: `session_id = 0` on every response —
  Apache's documented contract for "broker doesn't support sessions",
  so clients fall back to full Fetch data per request. KIP-227
  incremental sessions are a future optimisation, not a correctness
  gap.
- **The response is materialized bytes**, copied from the segment
  files; a `sendfile`/splice zero-copy path is a future optimisation
  (the codec keeps records byte-opaque exactly so that a splice path
  stays possible).

## Concurrency model: inside one Partition

What runs under the partition mutex, what the per-partition committer
task does, and what segment roll defers to a background task:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph appender["append() — any producer connection"]
        direction TB
        lock["take the partition mutex"] --> classify["sticky-error check · epoch fence ·<br/>idempotence classify"]
        classify --> roll{"segment full?"}
        roll -- yes --> rollfast["roll_fast: fsync log ·<br/>create new active · pointer swap<br/>(old FDs move into deferred closure)"]
        roll -- no --> write
        rollfast --> write["append_batch → pwrite on active log"]
        write --> snap["snapshot.store (ArcSwap)"]
        snap --> trigger["pending ≥ flush_interval_messages?<br/>requested_flush_seq += 1"]
        trigger --> unlock["drop lock"]
        unlock --> wait["acks = -1 and triggered:<br/>park on Notify until<br/>completed_flush_seq ≥ mine"]
    end

    subgraph committer["committer task — one per partition"]
        direction TB
        recv["wait for a flush request"] --> target["lock: target = requested_flush_seq<br/>(skip if already completed)"]
        target --> fsync["spawn_blocking { lock(); log.sync_all() }<br/>fsync runs holding the partition mutex"]
        fsync --> watchdog{"done within 30 s?"}
        watchdog -- yes --> ok["completed_flush_seq = target<br/>notify_waiters()"]
        watchdog -- "timeout / io error" --> dead["sticky flush_err = Stalled —<br/>partition fails fast on next append;<br/>orphaned fsync drains in background"]
    end

    subgraph deferred["deferred finalize — spawn_blocking after roll"]
        fin["fsync index · close old log + index FDs"]
    end

    trigger -- "capacity-1 channel — coalesces" --> recv
    ok -. "notify" .-> wait
    rollfast -.-> fin
    readers["lock-free readers: high_water() / log_start()<br/>load the ArcSwap snapshot — never touch the mutex"] -.-> snap
```

Three properties that make this work:

1. **Group commit**: N concurrent appenders share one fsync cycle — the
   capacity-1 flush channel coalesces requests, and every waiter with
   `flush_seq ≤ completed` wakes on the same `notify_waiters()`.
2. **Lock-free reads**: high-watermark / log-start observation goes
   through the `ArcSwap` snapshot, so a stuck NFS fsync can't stall
   metrics callbacks.
3. **Fsync watchdog**: a hung NFS server trips the 30 s timeout, sets a
   sticky `Stalled` error, and the partition fails fast instead of
   hanging appenders forever.

Note the current committer holds the partition mutex for the fsync
window (readers are unaffected via the ArcSwap; concurrent appenders
queue on the lock). Fsyncing a cloned FD outside the mutex is a known
follow-up, not what ships today.

    ...
```

`__cluster/` is the cluster-state directory — kaas's file-shaped
replacement for Kafka's internal topics. It can live on its own volume,
separate from topic data; see
[the RWX substrate contract](./nfs-substrate.md).

Each segment is a pair of files; the filename carries both the **leader
epoch** and the **base offset**, so a stale ex-leader's writes can
never physically collide with a new leader's segment:

```text
{epoch:08x}-{base_offset:020d}.log     ── append-only log of v2 RecordBatches
{epoch:08x}-{base_offset:020d}.index   ── sparse offset index, 8 bytes/entry
```

The manifest is written on partition open (takeover routes through
open) and on close/relinquish — **not** on segment roll and not per
append — so its `highWatermark` can lag in-memory state; recovery
treats the log as authoritative and reconciles on open by scanning the
active segment to the first malformed batch boundary. Who runs that
recovery, and when, is the next chapter —
[file-handle ownership & takeover](./file-handles.md).

### Recovery checkpoint — scanning only the tail

Re-scanning the whole active segment on every takeover is the dominant
cost of broker startup on NFS (O(active segment) at the substrate's
read bandwidth). A per-partition **recovery checkpoint** — Kafka's
recovery-point idea — bounds it. `recovery-checkpoint.json` records
`{segment_base, byte_pos, high_watermark}`: everything up to `byte_pos`
of the named active segment is fsynced, with that log-end-offset. The
committer refreshes it once the fsynced log grows a threshold (64 MiB)
past the last one, and a clean close writes it at EOF. On open,
recovery resumes the scan from `byte_pos` instead of byte 0 whenever
the checkpoint still names the current active segment; if it doesn't (a
roll happened since, or the file is missing/stale/truncated) it falls
back to a full scan — always correct, and cheap with a bounded segment
size.

The clean-shutdown fast path falls out for free and on **one** code
path: a graceful close leaves the checkpoint at EOF, so "scan from
checkpoint to EOF" reads zero bytes — the same path a crash takes,
which scans only the gap. The checkpoint is a pure optimization hint:
because a missing or wrong one just triggers a full scan, it never has
to be correct, only usually-present.

The index is **sparse**: one `(rel_offset: i32, file_pos: i32)` entry
every `index.interval.bytes` of log data (4 KiB default). Lookup
binary-searches to the closest entry ≤ the target offset, then scans
the log forward. The index is *not* fsynced on the hot path — it's
rebuildable from the log during takeover recovery, so only the log's
durability is on the `acks=all` promise.

## Byte opacity: the broker never parses records

Exactly three places on the Produce path touch the RecordBatch bytes,
and none of them decodes a record:

1. The request decoder carries the records as an opaque, zero-copy
   slice into the frame buffer.
2. The idempotence check peeks the fixed-size batch header for producer
   ID / epoch / sequence — header only.
3. The segment append peeks the head for
   `(base_offset, last_offset_delta, max_timestamp)` — header only.

After that, the same opaque bytes the client sent land verbatim on disk
(with the base offset rewritten in place): **the log file IS the wire
format**, which is what makes Fetch a byte copy rather than a
re-encode. Fetch is symmetric — batch bytes come back off disk
undecoded. The invariant is enforced by tripwire counters that must
stay at zero (see [Observability](./observability.md)) and by an
integration test.

## The durability dial

`KAAS_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MESSAGES` (default **1** = honest `acks=all`:
every batch waits for a group-commit fsync cycle) mirrors Apache
Kafka's `log.flush.interval.messages`. Raising it trades durability for
throughput by letting the committer skip cycles until N messages are
pending — same semantics, same trade, as Apache. On NFS substrates
where the COMMIT round-trip dominates, this and the group-commit
coalescing are the two levers that matter (see
[Performance](../operations/performance.md)).

## Retention, DeleteRecords, and compaction — the honest state

Per-topic policy flows from `KafkaTopic.spec.config` through the
operator-written `.config.json` into the broker, where a background
cleaner enforces it:

- **Retention** runs on a timer (five minutes by default, the same
  cadence and meaning as Apache's `log.retention.check.interval.ms`).
  Each pass drops closed segments that have aged past `retention.ms` or
  pushed the partition over `retention.bytes`, whichever reaps more.
  `-1` on either knob — or no config at all — means retain forever. The
  active segment is never reclaimed.
- **`DeleteRecords`** (API key 21) reclaims on demand rather than on a
  timer: it advances `logStartOffset` to a caller-chosen point and
  unlinks the closed segments that point fully covers. Topic deletion
  is the third path.
- **Compaction** is still missing. Its knobs `min.compaction.lag.ms` (KIP-58) and
  `delete.retention.ms` (KIP-354) round-trip through CRs and
  DescribeConfigs but gate nothing yet. When the compactor lands,
  tombstone expiry will be **per-batch** (Apache is per-record) — a
  deliberate consequence of never opening batches. Status is tracked
  honestly on the [KIP-58](../compat/kip/kip-58.md) and
  [KIP-354](../compat/kip/kip-354.md) pages.

### How old is a segment?

Time-based retention has to answer that per segment, and the answer is
less obvious than it looks. Apache keeps a *time index* alongside each
segment and reads the largest record timestamp out of it. kaas has no
time index, and its manifest — the small JSON file beside a partition's
segments — records the epoch, high watermark and log start offset, but
no per-segment list. So there is nowhere on disk for a segment's
largest timestamp to live.

kaas therefore uses the timestamp it *does* know for free. While a
segment is being written, the broker tracks the largest record
timestamp it has seen, and stamps that onto the segment when it rolls
closed. A segment closed by this broker, in this process, is dated by
its records — exactly like Apache.

Everything else is dated by the log file's **modification time**. That
covers every segment a broker inherits when it restarts or takes a
partition over from a peer. It is the same fallback Apache uses when a
segment has no usable timestamp, and it is well-behaved here: a closed
segment is never written again, so its mtime stops moving the moment it
rolls.

The practical difference is small but worth knowing: a producer that
back-dates its records — setting timestamps far in the past — will see
them aged out promptly by the broker that wrote them, and aged by
wall-clock arrival time by a broker that inherited them.

Retention only ever runs on the broker that **leads** the partition.
This is not an optimisation: on a shared volume, a second broker
deleting the same segments is a data race, and deleting a file another
broker still holds open doesn't free the space at all — the filesystem
just renames it out of the way. See [file-handle
ownership](./file-handles.md).

## Implementation notes (for contributors)

- Issue trail: the group-commit Produce path is gh #80/#81/#82; the
  lock-free ArcSwap read path is gh #134; the 30 s fsync watchdog is
  gh #95; stateless fetch sessions are gh #4; wiring the retention
  cleaner's interval loop was gh #250, and the compactor is still open
  on gh #158.
- Byte-opacity peeks: `kaas-storage/src/idempotence.rs` (PID / epoch /
  sequence) and `kaas-storage/src/segment.rs` (offsets / timestamp);
  the codec side is `kaas-codec` decoding
  `records: Option<bytes::Bytes>` as a zero-copy slice. Enforced by the
  tripwire counters and the `bins/kaas/tests/byte_opacity.rs`
  integration test.
- Topic-config plumbing: `crates/kaas-storage/src/topicconfig.rs`;
  `RetentionCleaner` and its policy sources:
  `crates/kaas-storage/src/cleaner.rs`; the interval loop and the
  leadership gate: `bins/kaas/src/main.rs`.
- The producer-fence files and marker queue in the layout above belong
  to the transaction machinery (gh #108 phase 2, gh #175) — see
  [Transactions & idempotence](./transactions.md).
- Index mmap is feature-gated behind `mmap`, the one unsafe-code
  carve-out in the workspace.
