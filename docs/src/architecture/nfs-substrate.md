# The RWX substrate contract

Apache Kafka gets durability and failover from **replication**. Every
partition has a leader and a set of in-sync followers, and a record
isn't acknowledged until it is on enough of them. Lose a broker and a
follower is promoted — the data was already there.

kaas makes a different bet. It runs on Kubernetes and stores every
partition on a **shared `ReadWriteMany` volume** with **one writer per
partition** and **no followers at all**. Durability comes from the
shared filesystem (plus whatever redundancy the storage itself
provides), and failover means a surviving broker opens the *same files*
the dead one was writing. There is no second copy to fall back on,
because the shared volume *is* the copy. (Why give up replication? See
the [non-goals](../compat/non-goals.md) — in short, it trades a replication
protocol and a consensus log for a much smaller system that leans on
Kubernetes and the filesystem instead.)

That bet buys a lot, but it moves the hard problems onto the
filesystem. kaas never speaks NFS — it does POSIX file operations on
whatever the CSI driver mounted — so the real requirement is not a
protocol but a **semantic contract**: three guarantees the substrate
must honor, spelled out below. NFS is the *reference substrate* the
contract was debugged against, and the floor it describes; correctness
depends on respecting what that floor actually promises, which is less
than most code assumes. The two previous chapters — the
[storage hot path](./storage-hot-path.md) and
[file-handle ownership](./file-handles.md) — showed the machinery; this
page is the contract that machinery obeys. Most of the subtle bugs in
kaas's history are what happens when a piece of code forgets it.

**Which filesystems qualify?** Any RWX filesystem that delivers the
three guarantees: the NFSv4.1 family (Linux kernel NFS, Azure NetApp
Files, FSx for NetApp ONTAP, EFS, Azure Files NFS), and coherent POSIX
filesystems like CephFS, which *exceed* the contract (stronger than
close-to-open, and no silly-rename behavior — though the coding rules
below still apply in full: read-modify-write and check-then-act are
non-atomic on every shared filesystem). Metadata-engine filesystems
over object storage (JuiceFS-class) satisfy the contract semantically
but bring their own operational tax and object-PUT fsync latency.
Disqualified regardless of protocol: SMB/CIFS (divergent
open/rename/locking semantics), FUSE object-store mounts whose rename
is copy+delete (s3fs, gcsfuse, Mountpoint for S3), and **any substrate
that lies about fsync — including an `async` NFS export, which is
"still NFS" and still breaks everything**. The risk direction is always
a substrate weaker than the contract, never stronger.

## What lives on the shared volume

Everything a broker needs to serve, and everything the cluster needs to
coordinate, is a file other brokers can read:

- **Partition logs** — `…/<topic>/<partition>/` with the usual segment
  and index files, the same idea as Kafka's on-disk log. Only a
  partition's current leader has them open.
- **The assignment file** — who leads what. This is kaas's equivalent
  of the partition-to-leader map Kafka keeps in its metadata log (or,
  pre-KRaft, in ZooKeeper). One broker — the elected
  [controller](./controller.md) — writes it; every broker reads it.
- **The state Kafka keeps in internal topics** — consumer offsets,
  transaction state, producer fences — are plain files here rather than
  `__consumer_offsets` and the transaction log. A broker that becomes a
  coordinator reads the same file the previous one wrote. This
  cluster-wide state lives in its own directory (`__cluster/` by
  default), and can live on its own *volume*: the broker and operator
  honor `KAAS_CLUSTER_DIR`, and the chart's `storage.controlPlane`
  mounts a dedicated control-plane volume so a runaway topic filling
  the data volume degrades into a per-topic produce error instead of
  taking cluster coordination down with it.

Because these files are read and written across brokers, every one of
them is exposed to the guarantees — and the non-guarantees — below.

## What the substrate actually guarantees

Three things, and only three — this is the contract's floor, which NFS
defines:

1. **A rename within one directory is atomic.** A reader sees the old
   target or the new one, never a half-written mix. This is the
   load-bearing primitive.
2. **An exclusive create (`open` with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`) is atomic.**
   Exactly one racer creates the file; the rest are told it already
   exists.
3. **Close-to-open consistency.** Once one host closes a file, the next
   host to open it sees the complete contents. This is how one broker
   reads what another wrote.

That is the whole toolbox. Everything you might *wish* were atomic is
not:

- **Recursive delete is not atomic.** It is a sequence of unlinks that
  can be observed, and interrupted, half-done.
- **Read-modify-write is not atomic.** Two writers interleave.
- **Check-then-act is not atomic.** "If it doesn't exist, create it" is
  a race — and "open a partition: make the directory, open the files,
  recover the tail" is exactly that shape.
- **Deleting a file another host has open is not clean.** NFS renames
  it to a hidden `.nfsXXXX` file and keeps the parent directory busy
  until every open handle closes. (This one is NFS-specific — CephFS
  behaves like a local filesystem here — but the
  [file-handle discipline](./file-handles.md) it forced is kept on
  every substrate, because it is what makes leader-side deletes
  actually free disk.)

You cannot make a recursive delete atomic on a shared filesystem. So
the goal is not "make everything atomic" — it is the following.

## The contract

> **1. Build durable state changes out of the atomic primitives.**
> Write a temp file, flush it, then rename it over the target. Never
> mutate a file in place where another host can catch it half-written.
>
> **2. If an operation can't be a single atomic step, make it
> idempotent and drive it to completion by retry.** On a shared volume
> it *will* race another actor or get interrupted, so "try once, log on
> failure" is a latent stuck state. Name the desired end-state, then
> re-drive toward it until it is reached.
>
> **3. Give every piece of state a single writer, fenced by epoch.** If
> only one broker ever writes a partition, there is no concurrent
> writer to race — and an epoch stamp lets a new leader reject a
> zombie's late writes. This is Kafka's leader-epoch idea, applied to
> files.

Every rule here was paid for by a production bug; the
[contributor notes](#implementation-notes-for-contributors) at the end
of this chapter catalogue them and give the review checklist that keeps
new code honest.

### Rule 1 in practice

Every metadata file kaas persists — the per-partition manifest, the
producer-state snapshot, the assignment file, the operator-written
topic config — is written to a temp name, flushed, and renamed into
place, so a reader sees either the previous version or the next one and
never a torn write. Segment logs are never edited in place either: they
are append-only, and a segment roll creates a new (epoch-stamped) file
and swaps a pointer. A new persisted file goes through the same
temp-then-rename path, no exceptions.

### Rule 2 is the one that gets forgotten

A multi-step operation that isn't retried turns a momentary hiccup into
a permanent fault. The mental model is **name the end-state, then
converge to it** — never assume one attempt either fully succeeds or is
someone else's problem. "Log a warning and move on" is the anti-pattern
this rule exists to kill.

### Rule 3 is kaas's core model

Only a partition's leader writes its log, and segment filenames carry
the leadership epoch, so a stale leader's late write lands in a file
the new leader ignores — Kafka's zombie fencing, done through the
filesystem (see
[file-handle ownership & takeover](./file-handles.md)). Where this
breaks down is when a *second* actor touches state the single writer
owns — for instance the operator deleting a topic's directory while a
broker still has that partition open. That is outside rule 3, and it is
exactly where races live.

## Names are not identities

The three rules govern *concurrent* access. One class of bug slips past
all of them, because no two writers ever run at once: state addressed
by a **name** that gets reused.

A partition's directory is addressed by name —
`/data/<topic>/<partition>/`. Delete a topic and recreate it under the
same name (Kafka Streams' `application-reset` does this on every run)
and the new topic silently inherits the old one's segments, high
watermark, and idempotence dedupe window. No race, no second writer —
the second incarnation simply moved into the first one's house. The
visible symptom was a producer whose very first batch came back
`OUT_OF_ORDER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` — or worse, was accepted and silently
discarded as a duplicate of a record written by a producer that no
longer existed.

The same shape shows up wherever an identifier is recycled: a producer
ID reissued after a broker restart lands a fresh producer on a dead
one's sequence history, which is why kaas allocates producer IDs from a
persisted, per-broker block (see
[transactions & idempotence](./transactions.md)).

Apache Kafka answers this with topic IDs (KIP-516) and producer-ID
blocks. kaas answers it the same way: the operator stamps each topic
directory with the CR's `Status.TopicID` (`.topic-id.json`) and
reclaims the directory when the stamp belongs to a previous
incarnation — a reconcile-time check, so it needs no delete event and
no ordering between watchers. An *unstamped* directory is always
adopted, never reclaimed: "unknown identity" must not be destructive.

## Why this matters more for kaas than for Kafka

In Apache Kafka a broker's local disk is one replica among several: a
corner case on one node is masked by the others, and the filesystem is
rarely the point where the cluster coordinates. In kaas the shared
volume is the *only* copy and the coordination point for the whole
cluster, so a filesystem race isn't masked — it *is* the failure. This
contract is what keeps "single writer on shared storage" as safe in
practice as "replicated across brokers" is in Kafka.

## Implementation notes (for contributors)

Any change that touches the shared volume gets reviewed against four
questions before it ships:

1. Is this a single atomic primitive — a same-directory rename, or an
   exclusive create?
2. If not, is it idempotent and safe to re-drive until it completes?
3. Is there exactly one writer, fenced by epoch, against the rest?
4. Does this path assume a *name* identifies its state uniquely — over
   time, not just at this instant?

If all answers are "no," the code has a latent race — no matter how
cleanly it passes on a single broker backed by a local disk.

The checklist is not theoretical. Each entry below shipped as a real
bug, and each is one rule ignored:

| what went wrong | rule broken | the fix |
|---|---|---|
| The operator's reclaim of a removed topic's directory ran a recursive delete on the **live** path while a broker was concurrently opening the same partition — the two raced into "file not found" (gh #203). | 3 — two writers | Rename the directory aside in one atomic step, then delete the *renamed* copy, which no broker will ever open. |
| A broker being promoted to a partition's leader hit a transient "file not found" while opening the log, logged it, and never retried — so the partition stayed unopened and the broker never finished coming up (gh #215). | 2 — not retried | A reconcile loop re-drives the open for any partition the broker should lead but hasn't opened yet; opening an already-open partition is a no-op, so retrying is always safe. |
| A cleanup sweep aborted on the first directory it couldn't remove — busy because a broker still held a handle — stranding every other orphan behind it (gh #205). | 2 — not resumable | Collect per-directory failures and continue; re-run periodically, since the "busy" condition clears once the handles close. |
| Deleting a file a broker still had open left a `.nfsXXXX` tombstone that kept the parent directory busy and blocked cleanup (gh #76). | 3 — single-writer FD discipline | Only the leader holds a partition's file handles, and it closes them before any delete; combined with the rename-aside above, a stray tombstone lands in a throwaway path instead of the live one. |
| Reclaiming a recreated topic's directory renamed it aside and then ran the recursive delete *before* re-creating the live path — leaving that path absent for the whole unlink walk (554 ms measured), so a broker opening a partition in that window failed (gh #220). | 2 — a two-step treated as atomic | Re-create the live path immediately after the rename and delete the staged copy afterwards, so the gap is a few `mkdir`s instead of a full delete; and make the opener retry, since after its own `mkdir_all` a "file not found" can only mean someone is re-creating the path. |
| A topic deleted and recreated under the same name inherited the dead incarnation's segments, high watermark, and dedupe window (gh #219). | 4 — name reuse | The `.topic-id.json` incarnation stamp and reconcile-time reclaim described above. |
| The per-partition manifest was read-modify-written by several paths, so a takeover completing inside another writer's read-work-write gap got replayed over — silently lowering the durable epoch and unarming the zombie fence (gh #235). | 3 — two writers | Every manifest write re-reads the on-disk file just before writing and skips itself if the epoch there is higher — no writer may lower the epoch, and identical writes are skipped outright. |
| A broker that already had a topic's directory open when the operator renamed it aside kept appending into the staged `.deleting-*` copy — FDs follow the inode — while the live path served an empty log, with no error anywhere (gh #241). | 3 — two writers | Partition open consults the topic's incarnation identity and refuses (retriably) to open a directory stamped with a previous incarnation's ID, until the operator's reclaim lands. |
| A tail torn by a crash mid-write was accepted as valid data on recovery: appends resumed after the garbage, and the *next* recovery stopped at the tear — losing every acked record written past it (gh #226/#228). | 2 — not driven to a verified end-state | The recovery scan verifies each batch's CRC and truncates the log to the last byte it *proved* valid before any write handle is used — a clean log is never touched, and the scan is bounded by the recovery checkpoint. |

Note the fifth entry was found by *this document's own checklist*,
applied to a fix for the first: rename-aside solved a rule-3 race and
quietly introduced a rule-2 one, because "rename, then delete, then
re-create" is three steps and only the rename is atomic. That is the
argument for writing the contract down — the next reviewer, holding it,
can catch the next one before it ships.
